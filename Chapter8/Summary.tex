\section{Summary}

In summary, this thesis set out to investigate whether or not there was a better, more efficient way of identifying malicious incoming traffic to websites. A formula was developed that could use the data collected in the log files of web servers in order to assess the potential malignancy of incoming traffic. The formula was successful in diagnosing malicious traffic with a high degree of accuracy. The small number of false alerts that were generated by the formula were then successfully de-escalated by a human moderator utilising the user interface to investigate the log file data. The system as a whole was deemed to work as intended as a complete package to analyse website traffic and accurately identify whether or not it can be described as malicious.
