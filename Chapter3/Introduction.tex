\section*{Introduction}
This chapter will look at the various types of high bandwidth attacks that can occur, in particular looking at DDOS attacks. A high rate bandwidth attack is essentially a malicious attempt to over run a server with an immense amount of traffic in an attempt to disrupt its functionality. Unlike the port scanning and low rate attacks mentioned in the prior chapter, the high rate attack sends multitudes of requests all at the same time. It is important to note that the effects delivered from these types of attacks are the most devastating of the three types of attacks that have been discussed to this point. A successful attack can essentially lock-down a targeted website that is unprotected for the duration of the attack.
