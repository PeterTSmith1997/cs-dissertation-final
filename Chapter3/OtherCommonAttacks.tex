\section{Other common attacks} \label{attack3}
A highly common attack on Wordpress websites is a brute force login attack. These attacks are relatively easy to do as they only involve trying to guess user names and passwords. There are solutions such as Wordfence that will detect and block these attacks, however, there is an inherent weakness of this whereby there is a chance that there is an attack so large that it will become powerful enough to take down the server. Solutions already exist for this type of attack, therefore my software only needs to look at whether a user is trying to access the login page, and factor this into the risk for an IP address.

An SQL injection attack is a common form of attack as most websites use an SQL database in some capacity. The inherent attack risk with any SQL application, particularly websites is usually people injecting malicious code into text boxes that are not checked before being sent to the database, therefore, allowing them to run in the database undetected.
