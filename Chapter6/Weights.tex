\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{ll}

400           & +0.5    \\
401           & +5.0    \\
404           & +1.0 \\
403           & +2.0    \\
429           & +2.0    \\
500           & +0.2    \\
200           & -1.0   
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If the URL contains 'Wp-Admin' then we shall apply an additional 3 to the risk related factor. If the URL contains 'login' in any case format an application of an additional 2 will be added to the risk factor. If the server responds with no data we shall apply an additional risk factor of 6.
